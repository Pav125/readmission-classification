# Hospital Readmission Prediction using ML Techniques

This repository contains the final version of my project to identify determinants of, and predict hospital readmission in medical data. I utilized various machine learning techniques to analyze the data and build predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle at [Hospital Readmissions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/hospital-readmissions). It contains information on patient demographics, diagnoses, medications, and hospital encounters.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Jupyter notebook containing code for preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling**: Jupyter notebook containing code for building machine learning models to predict hospital readmissions.
- **Output Files**: Final output files produced from the analysis, including prediction results.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions

To reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Pav125/readmission-classification.git
    cd readmission-classification
    ```

2. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**
